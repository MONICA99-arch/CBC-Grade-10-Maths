        <em><term>Quadratic equations</term></em> are a type of mathematical equation that can be used to describe many different <em><term>real-life</term></em> situations.

                    A company finds that the revenue <m>R(x)</m> it generates from selling <m>x</m> units of a product is given by the quadratic equation:
                    <me>
                        R(x) = 2x^2 + 40x
                    </me>
                    Find the number of units <m>x</m> that the company needs to sell to maximize its revenue.
                </p>
            </statement>
            <answer>
                  <p>
                     To find the number of units that maximizes revenue, we can use the formula for the vertex of a parabola given by a quadratic equation in the form <m>ax^2 + bx + c</m>, which is <m>x = -\frac{b}{2a}</m>.
                     In this case, <m>a = 2</m> and <m>b = 40</m>.
                     Substitute these values into the formula:
                     <me>
                        x = -\frac{40}{2 \cdot 2} = -\frac{40}{4} = -10
                     </me>
                     Since the number of units cannot be negative, we need to check the behavior of the quadratic function to determine if it opens upwards or downwards. 
                     Since <m>a &gt; 0</m>, the fuction opens upwards, meaning that the vertex represents a minimum point. 
                     Therefore, there is no maximum revenue in this case, and the company can increase its revenue indefinitely by selling more units.
